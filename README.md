# About-Me-

The first homework assignment for the Girls Code First Web Development course.

## Assignment
Create a simple intro page about yourself following this format:

1. Title of the page
2. A photo of yourself
3. An unordered list with some points about yourself.

## Notes
I have created simple pages before so this one was not a challenge. It is nice to practice basic skills though.
